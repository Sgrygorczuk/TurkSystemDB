# Turk System DB

This just covers the backend portion of the project using python and json. There will be the User, Project, Team, Bid, and Task classes to interact with the json files using jasonIO. Finally initial_data provides initial data and ezcommands provides function to interact with the front end.

## Getting Started

First use initial_data to first create an initial data, then use ezcommands to call upon functions that analyze or modify your classes and database.

### Prerequisites

You might need NumPy to run this.
